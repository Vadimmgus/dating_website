# Web-site for meeting

## Main task:

   Create backend for meeting web-site.

### Tasks:

1. Create a participant model. The participant must have an avatar, gender, first and last name, mail.
2. Create a new member registration endpoint: `/api/clients/create`.
3. When registering a new participant, it is necessary to process his avatar: put a watermark on it.
4. Create an evaluation endpoint by a member of another member: `/api/clients/{id}/match`. In the event that mutual sympathy arises, then we issue a mail to the client in response and send it to the mail of the participants: `â€œYou liked <name>! Participant's mail: <mail>"`.
5. Create a member list endpoint: `/api/list`. It should be possible to filter the list by gender, first name, last name.
6. Implement the definition of the distance between the participants. Add longitude and latitude fields. Add an additional filter to the list api that shows participants within a given distance relative to an authorized user.
